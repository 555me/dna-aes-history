# about pak
you can select all paks in the game folder, but you must confirm which AES key a certain pak needs to use.<br/>
The AES key of the OS server may be the same as the CN. If you cannot use it, you can provide me with the required file. If you already know that you can use AES, you can edit it in your own fork and submit a Pull request.
